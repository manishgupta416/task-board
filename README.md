## About Challenges I faced

- One of the significant challenges I encountered was during the implementation of the drag and drop feature, which I had never worked with before. I got stuck for an extended period, struggling to identify why I couldn't achieve the drag and drop functionality. I consistently encountered an error message stating **"Cannot find 'droppable' and 'draggable' entry IDs."** With the help of stackover flow forum, I was able to resolve this issue. The root cause turned out to be the usage of React's strict mode, which was causing the problem.

- Another challenge arose when I was implementing the task metrics feature, implementing react charts for the first time. Initially, I needed some time to grasp how I could accomplish this task. To overcome this, I decided to break down the process into smaller parts and then carefully understand the flow of data and rendering. Once I had a clear understanding of the flow, the implementation process became easier.

## About Design decisions

- Initially, I began with a simple UI layout consisting of heading and four columns as per to achieve requirements first. Once I successfully implemented the drag and drop functionality, I took design inspiration from the provided image. I aimed to create a similar look with my unique touch. This involved layout styling , colors , element positioning to achieve the similar kind of UI.
